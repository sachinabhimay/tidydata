# tidydata
This repo includes R scripts for cleaning data on coursera week 4 project.  

It uses two R Packages:  
  1. data.table
  2. dplyr
  
## Steps to follow:
  1. Set working directory
  2. Read data and check the features of data
      * read dimensions
      * read variables
      * look for common key
  3. Give proper names to variables
  4. Select requied portion of data into separate data frame and don't mess with raw data frame directly to avoid re-reading in case of failure.
  5. Go through the assignmnet steps one my one
  6. Once complelete save the commit and push the assignment on git
  7. Create a markdown file to explain steps.
  
It uses data set from Coursera. Which can be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
#### Including library
``` 
library(data.table)
library(dplyr) 
```

#### Reading features names
``` 
feature <- read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt") 
```

#### Reading activity name
``` 
activity_labels <- read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt") 
```

#### Reading training dataset
``` 
X_train <- read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt") 
```
#### Reading activity dataset
``` 
y_train <- read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt") 
```

#### Reading subject names in training dataset
``` 
subject_train <- read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
```

#### Reading testing dataset
```
X_test <-read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt") 
```

#### Reading activity dataset
```
y_test <- read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt") 
```

#### Reading subject names in testing dataset
``` 
subject_test <- read.table("../data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
```

## Part 4:

#### Assigning names to dataset from features
```
names(X_train) <- feature$V2 
```

#### Assigning names to dataset from features
``` 
names(X_test) <- feature$V2
```

#### Assigning "Subject" as variable name 
``` 
names(subject_train) <- c("subject")
names(subject_test) <- c("subject")
```

#### Assigning "Result" as varible name
``` 
names(y_train) <- c("result")
names(y_test) <- c("result")
```
#### Read subject_train X_train y_train
```
data_train <- cbind(subject_train, X_train, y_train)
```
#### Read subject_test X_test y_test
```
data_test <- cbind(subject_test, X_test, y_test)
```

## Part 1:

#### Combining data_train + data_test
```
data <- rbind(data_train , data_test)
```
## Part 2:

#### Finding columns with mean or std
```
colnumbers <- grep("mean()|std()", names(data))
```
#### New data with only mean and standard deviation
```
data_sim <- data[,c(1, colnumbers, 563)]
```

## Part 3:

#### Assigning names to result variable as activity name
```
data_sim$result = as.character(factor(data_sim$result, labels = activity_labels$V2))
```
#### To tbl format
```
data_sim_tbl <- tbl_df(data_sim)
```
#### Grouping by subject and result
```
data_sim_tbl_group <- group_by(data_sim_tbl, subject, result)
```

## Part 5:

#### Applying mean over the group
```
data_final <- summarise_all(data_sim_tbl_group, mean)
```
